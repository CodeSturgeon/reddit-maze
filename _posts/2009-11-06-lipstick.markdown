Between my regular schedule and babies hopped up on flu vaccine, it's been tough day for making headway.

Made some site pages and got to grips with [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and managed to make something usable.

Added a welcome page to the application making things a touch more user friendly.
