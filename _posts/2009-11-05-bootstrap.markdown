Today I got a lot done. The demo is now functional and  playable even if it is a bit dull.

Bootstrapped with in-app maze generation, then setup remote_api for practical remote generation. Trying to get serialize data in to csv fields is not easy... had to resort to an ugly hack.

One really odd thing... Why do I have to hack the cwd in to the path for the bulk loader? Seems like a bug.
