Productive day. The demo is now functional and  playable even if it is a bit dull. Findable [here][client_url].

Bootstrapped with in-app maze generation, then setup remote api for practical remote generation. Trying to get serialize data in to csv fields is not easy... had to resort to an ugly hack.

One really odd thing... Why do I have to hack the cwd in to the path for the GAE bulk loader? Seems like a bug.
