After nearly a year of travels through the realms of new employment and other intrigues, interest has again come to this land.

Experimented with the new git base wiki goodness that github has to offer. Somewhat feature limited (no namespaces?) but the core idea is good.

Created many new wiki pages detailing the API used between the client and the server. Still a long way to go before it's 'good enough' let alone 'good'.

Discussions have lead to the need for JSONP to ease client development issues... watch this repo for more on that soon.
