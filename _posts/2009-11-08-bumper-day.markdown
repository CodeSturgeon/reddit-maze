Today was a bumper day. Lots of time to work and good progress made.

Major improvements to maze_gen performance and progress reporting. Improved bulk uploading and management too. Surprised to find simplejson a little faster and more compact that ASCII cPickle for my use case.

Implemented picture->maze util for BCN's maze.

Memcache implemented for Tiles.

Shapes implemented in Tiles for pretty view rendering.

Basic avatar stats implemented.

More client configuration query variables.
