When I saw [BarcodeNinja's maze][reddit_maze] (via [mythogen's posted solver][reddit_solver]), I was happy to know I'm not the only one geeking out on mazes. I decided to take some ideas I have been playing with and sprint it in to a little online game.

There is now a version fit for public consumption, find it here: [reddit-maze].
